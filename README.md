# Study-of-Air-Pollution-and-Prediction

**Problem Statement:**

Our experiment is based on data from different states of India . Dataset is combined(across the years and states) and largely clean version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP). 

# **Dataset:**
The Dataset contains 13 features and  435742 entries. The data have been collected from 36 states(including union territories).There are 304 locations altogether.The data have been recorded from year 1970 to 2015.Our aim is to find a model which can predict the future value of  AQI.

**Dataset Featuers:**

The dataset contains the following features :

1. **stn_code** : Station code. A code given to each station that recorded the data.
2. **sampling_date** : The date when the data was recorded.
3. **state** : It represents the states whose air quality data is measured.
4. **location** : It represents the city whose air quality data is measured.
5. **agency** : Name of the agency that measured the data.
6. **type** : The type of area where the measurement was made.
7. **so2** : The amount of Sulphur Dioxide measured.
8. **no2** : The amount of Nitrogen Dioxide measured
9. **rspm** : Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter measured.
10. **spm** : Suspended Particulate Matter measured.
11. **location_monitoring_station** : It indicates the location of the monitoring area.
12. **pm2_5** : It represents the value of particulate matter measured.
13. **date** : It represents the date of recording (It is cleaner version of ‘sampling_date’ feature)
